This is the first website task that the Odin Project is giving me. I only really know HTML so far and after this I will have demonstrated a good understanding of how to build a very basic blog-type website. The entire Git process is still soemthing I need to work on as the whole staging, pushing, committing thing feels unessecarily lengthy.
